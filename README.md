### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<!-- I am rather proud of this html because it was the first application of span and span classes outside of a learning environment.  -->
<h3>
  <span class="name">Victor Crest</span>
  <span class="age">26</span>
</h3>
```

```css
/* learned about how to set multiple background images here */
body{background-image: url(https://www.linkpicture.com/q/bg-pattern-top_2.svg),
url(https://www.linkpicture.com/q/bg-pattern-bottom_1.svg);
/* major learning moment starts here. Setting the position of each seperate background image the first set of values is applied to the first set then a comma seperates the position values for the next image. */
background-position: right 45vw bottom 45vh, 45vw 45vh;}
```

### Continued development
/* I still need to work on positioning. I am still having to heavily reference solutions of other programmers for seamingly easy solutions. I don't copy and paste, and I always end up changing the code because I try and simply and use best practices like not target id's heavily. */

  ### Useful resources

/* -Great for learning about flexboxes. [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/] */
